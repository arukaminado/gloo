### Pipe



```yaml
"path": string
"mode": int

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `path` | `string` | Unix Domain Socket path. On Linux, paths starting with '@' will use the abstract namespace. The starting '@' is replaced by a null byte by Envoy. Paths starting with '@' will result in an error in environments other than Linux. |  |
| `mode` | `int` | The mode for the Pipe. Not applicable for abstract sockets. |  |

### SocketAddress

 
[#next-free-field: 7]

```yaml
"protocol": .envoy.config.core.v3.SocketAddress.Protocol
"address": string
"portValue": int
"namedPort": string
"resolverName": string
"ipv4Compat": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `protocol` | [.envoy.config.core.v3.SocketAddress.Protocol](../address.proto.sk/#protocol) |  |  |
| `address` | `string` | The address for this socket. :ref:`Listeners <config_listeners>` will bind to the address. An empty address is not allowed. Specify ``0.0.0.0`` or ``::`` to bind to any address. [#comment:TODO(zuercher) reinstate when implemented: It is possible to distinguish a Listener address via the prefix/suffix matching in :ref:`FilterChainMatch <envoy_api_msg_config.listener.v3.FilterChainMatch>`.] When used within an upstream :ref:`BindConfig <envoy_api_msg_config.core.v3.BindConfig>`, the address controls the source address of outbound connections. For :ref:`clusters <envoy_api_msg_config.cluster.v3.Cluster>`, the cluster type determines whether the address must be an IP (*STATIC* or *EDS* clusters) or a hostname resolved by DNS (*STRICT_DNS* or *LOGICAL_DNS* clusters). Address resolution can be customized via :ref:`resolver_name <envoy_api_field_config.core.v3.SocketAddress.resolver_name>`. |  |
| `portValue` | `int` |  Only one of `portValue` or `namedPort` can be set. |  |
| `namedPort` | `string` | This is only valid if :ref:`resolver_name <envoy_api_field_config.core.v3.SocketAddress.resolver_name>` is specified below and the named resolver is capable of named port resolution. Only one of `namedPort` or `portValue` can be set. |  |
| `resolverName` | `string` | The name of the custom resolver. This must have been registered with Envoy. If this is empty, a context dependent default applies. If the address is a concrete IP address, no resolution will occur. If address is a hostname this should be set for resolution other than DNS. Specifying a custom resolver with *STRICT_DNS* or *LOGICAL_DNS* will generate an error at runtime. |  |
| `ipv4Compat` | `bool` | When binding to an IPv6 address above, this enables `IPv4 compatibility <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3493#page-11>`_. Binding to ``::`` will allow both IPv4 and IPv6 connections, with peer IPv4 addresses mapped into IPv6 space as ``::FFFF:<IPv4-address>``. |  |

### Protocol



| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `TCP` |  |
| `UDP` |  |




---
### Address

 
Addresses specify either a logical or physical address and port, which are
used to tell Envoy where to bind/listen, connect to upstream and find
management servers.

```yaml
"socketAddress": .envoy.config.core.v3.SocketAddress
"pipe": .envoy.config.core.v3.Pipe

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `socketAddress` | [.envoy.config.core.v3.SocketAddress](../address.proto.sk/#socketaddress) |  Only one of `socketAddress` or `pipe` can be set. |  |
| `pipe` | [.envoy.config.core.v3.Pipe](../address.proto.sk/#pipe) |  Only one of `pipe` or `socketAddress` can be set. |  |
