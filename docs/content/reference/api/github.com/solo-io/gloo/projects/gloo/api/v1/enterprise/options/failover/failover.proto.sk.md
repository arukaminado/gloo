### Failover

 
Failover configuration for an upstream.

Failover allows for optional fallback endpoints in the case that the primary set of endpoints is deemed
unhealthy. As failover requires knowledge of the health of each set of endpoints, active or passive
health checks must be configured on an upstream using failover in order for it to work properly.

Failover closely resembles the Envoy config which this is translated to, with one notable exception.
The priorities are not defined on the `LocalityLbEndpoints` but rather inferred from the list of
`PrioritizedLocality`. More information on envoy prioritization can be found
[here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.14.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/priority#arch-overview-load-balancing-priority-levels).
In practice this means that the priority of a given set of `LocalityLbEndpoints` is determined by it's index in
the list, first being `0` through `n-1`.

```yaml
"locality": .envoy.config.core.v3.Locality
"prioritizedLocalities": []failover.options.gloo.solo.io.Failover.PrioritizedLocality

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `locality` | [.envoy.config.core.v3.Locality](../../../../../../../../../../../envoy/config/core/v3/base.proto.sk/#locality) | Identifies location of where the parent upstream hosts run. |  |
| `prioritizedLocalities` | [[]failover.options.gloo.solo.io.Failover.PrioritizedLocality](../failover.proto.sk/#prioritizedlocality) | PrioritizedLocality is an implicitly prioritized list of lists of `LocalityLbEndpoints`. The priority of each list of `LocalityLbEndpoints` is determined by it's index in the list. |  |




---
### PrioritizedLocality



```yaml
"localityEndpoints": []failover.options.gloo.solo.io.LocalityLbEndpoints

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `localityEndpoints` | [[]failover.options.gloo.solo.io.LocalityLbEndpoints](../failover.proto.sk/#localitylbendpoints) |  |  |




---
### Endpoint

 
Upstream host identifier.

```yaml
"address": string
"port": int
"healthCheckConfig": .failover.options.gloo.solo.io.Endpoint.HealthCheckConfig
"upstreamSslConfig": .core.gloo.solo.io.UpstreamSslConfig

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `address` | `string` | Address (hostname or IP). |  |
| `port` | `int` | Port the instance is listening on. |  |
| `healthCheckConfig` | [.failover.options.gloo.solo.io.Endpoint.HealthCheckConfig](../failover.proto.sk/#healthcheckconfig) | The optional health check configuration is used as configuration for the health checker to contact the health checked host. .. attention:: This takes into effect only for upstream clusters with :ref:`active health checking <arch_overview_health_checking>` enabled. |  |
| `upstreamSslConfig` | [.core.gloo.solo.io.UpstreamSslConfig](../../../../core/ssl.proto.sk/#upstreamsslconfig) |  |  |




---
### HealthCheckConfig

 
The optional health check configuration.

```yaml
"portValue": int
"hostname": string

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `portValue` | `int` | Optional alternative health check port value. By default the health check address port of an upstream host is the same as the host's serving address port. This provides an alternative health check port. Setting this with a non-zero value allows an upstream host to have different health check address port. |  |
| `hostname` | `string` | By default, the host header for L7 health checks is controlled by cluster level configuration (see: :ref:`host <envoy_api_field_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck.host>` and :ref:`authority <envoy_api_field_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.GrpcHealthCheck.authority>`). Setting this to a non-empty value allows overriding the cluster level configuration for a specific endpoint. |  |




---
### LbEndpoint

 
An Endpoint that Envoy can route traffic to.
[#next-free-field: 6]

```yaml
"endpoint": .failover.options.gloo.solo.io.Endpoint
"loadBalancingWeight": .google.protobuf.UInt32Value

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `endpoint` | [.failover.options.gloo.solo.io.Endpoint](../failover.proto.sk/#endpoint) |  |  |
| `loadBalancingWeight` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | The optional load balancing weight of the upstream host; at least 1. Envoy uses the load balancing weight in some of the built in load balancers. The load balancing weight for an endpoint is divided by the sum of the weights of all endpoints in the endpoint's locality to produce a percentage of traffic for the endpoint. This percentage is then further weighted by the endpoint's locality's load balancing weight from LocalityLbEndpoints. If unspecified, each host is presumed to have equal weight in a locality. |  |




---
### LocalityLbEndpoints

 
A group of endpoints belonging to a Locality.
One can have multiple LocalityLbEndpoints for a locality, but this is
generally only done if the different groups need to have different load
balancing weights or different priorities.

```yaml
"locality": .envoy.config.core.v3.Locality
"lbEndpoints": []failover.options.gloo.solo.io.LbEndpoint
"loadBalancingWeight": .google.protobuf.UInt32Value

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `locality` | [.envoy.config.core.v3.Locality](../../../../../../../../../../../envoy/config/core/v3/base.proto.sk/#locality) | Identifies location of where the upstream hosts run. |  |
| `lbEndpoints` | [[]failover.options.gloo.solo.io.LbEndpoint](../failover.proto.sk/#lbendpoint) | The group of endpoints belonging to the locality specified. |  |
| `loadBalancingWeight` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | Optional: Per priority/region/zone/sub_zone weight; at least 1. The load balancing weight for a locality is divided by the sum of the weights of all localities at the same priority level to produce the effective percentage of traffic for the locality. Locality weights are only considered when :ref:`locality weighted load balancing <arch_overview_load_balancing_locality_weighted_lb>` is configured. These weights are ignored otherwise. If no weights are specified when locality weighted load balancing is enabled, the locality is assigned no load. |  |
