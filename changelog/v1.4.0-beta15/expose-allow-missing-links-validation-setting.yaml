changelog:
  - type: FIX
    description: >-
      Expose a validation setting (`allowMissingLinks`, default `true`) in the API and in helm that was intended to be
      exposed. When set to false, the validation webhook will begin rejecting resources that cause warnings in
      addition to resources that would cause errors. For this to take affect, note that the validation setting
      `alwaysAccept` must be set to false. (default `true`)
